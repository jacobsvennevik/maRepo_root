You are an expert academic assistant. Your task is to extract structured information from the provided course syllabus text.

Here is the syllabus text to analyze:
{text}

The required JSON schema is:
{{
  "course_title": "The full title of the course",
  "education_level": "The level of education (e.g., 'Bachelor', 'Master', 'PhD', 'Continuing Education')",
  "exam_dates": [
    {{ "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "description": "A brief description of the exam (e.g., 'Mid-term exam', 'Final exam', 'Project deadline')" }}
  ],
  "instructor": "The name of the primary instructor or course coordinator",
  "topics": ["A list of the main topics, subjects, or modules covered in the course"]
}}

Rules:
1.  If a field is not present in the text, use a reasonable null-equivalent, like an empty string "" for titles, or an empty list [] for arrays.
2.  Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the year is not specified, assume the current year.
3.  Be precise. Do not add information that is not present in the text.
4.  Return ONLY the JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown or any other text.
