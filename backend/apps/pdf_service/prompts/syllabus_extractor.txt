You are an expert academic assistant. Your task is to extract structured information from the provided course syllabus text.

Here is the syllabus text to analyze:
{text}

The required JSON schema is:
{
  "course_title": "The full title of the course",
  "course_type": "The category of the course (e.g., 'STEM', 'Humanities', 'Language', 'Business', 'Arts', 'Mixed'). Infer this from the title and topics.",
  "education_level": "The level of education (e.g., 'Bachelor', 'Master', 'PhD', 'Continuing Education')",
  "exam_dates": [
    { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "description": "A brief description of the exam (e.g., 'Mid-term exam', 'Final exam', 'Project deadline')", "format": "Format or type of assessment (e.g., written, oral, project, multiple choice, essay, etc.)", "weight": "Percentage or weight towards the final grade, if specified (e.g., '20%', '10/100', or leave blank if not specified)" }
  ],
  "instructor": "The name of the primary instructor or course coordinator",
  "topics": ["A list of the main topics, subjects, or modules covered in the course"]
}

Rules:
1. For each exam, test, quiz, project, or assessment, extract as much detail as possible: date, description, format/type, and weight/percentage. If any detail is missing, leave it as an empty string "".
2. Infer the course_type from the course title and the topics. For example, a course on 'Literary Analysis' would be 'Humanities', 'Quantum Mechanics' would be 'STEM'. If multiple categories apply, use 'Mixed'.
3. If a field is not present in the text, use a reasonable null-equivalent, like an empty string "" for titles, or an empty list [] for arrays.
4. Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the year is not specified, assume the current year.
5. Be precise. Do not add information that is not present in the text.
6. Return ONLY the JSON object and nothing else. Do not wrap it in markdown or any other text.
