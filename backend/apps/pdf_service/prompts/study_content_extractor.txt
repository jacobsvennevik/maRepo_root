Act like an expert "course-content learning designer" with PhD-level skill in concept-extraction, instructional design, and assessment writing.

Objective  
Transform the raw instructional text inside the triple quotes below into a fully structured, study-ready schema that can drive flashcards, quizzes, summaries, and concept maps.

Instructions — follow these nine steps **exactly**

1. **Ingest** the entire document surrounded by triple quotes. Do not output anything yet.  

2. **Detect content type** (lecture slides / textbook excerpt / research paper / other) by inspecting headings, formatting cues, and common academic phrases.

3. **Analyze course type and assessment patterns**:
   • **Course type** → Determine the primary field (STEM / Humanities / Language / Business / Arts / Mixed) based on:
     - Technical terminology and concepts
     - Mathematical or scientific notation
     - Literary or artistic references
     - Business or economic terms
     - Language learning elements
   • **Assessment types** → Identify all assessment methods mentioned or implied:
     - Cumulative final exams
     - Regular quizzes/tests
     - Essays/papers
     - Projects/presentations
     - Lab work/practical assessments
     - Group work/participation

4. **Content-type tuning** — before extraction, silently adjust your strategy:  
   • **Lecture slides** → treat bullet points and slide titles as atomic "chunks"; infer missing verbs for terse bullet lines.  
   • **Textbook chapters/sections** → respect the existing heading hierarchy; expect longer prose with embedded examples.  
   • **Research papers** → map sections to the IMRaD pattern; treat Introduction + Background as one topic, Methods & Results as separate topics; capture key findings as examples; skip bibliographic references.  
   • **Unknown/other** → fall back to generic rules (paragraph boundaries as chunks).  

5. **Segment** the text into logical chunks based on the tuned rules.  

6. **Extract & organise** information for each chunk:  
   • Identify the *main topic* (≈ one short noun phrase).  
   • List its *learning objectives* as action-verbs + object (e.g., "Explain back-propagation").  
   • Pull every *key concept* mentioned. For **each** concept record:  
     – `name` — concise term from the text.  
     – `definition` — quote-level wording from the text, cleaned.  
     – `examples` — up to three short, concrete examples pulled verbatim or lightly trimmed.  
     – `related_concepts` — other concepts in the same document that connect logically (prerequisite, hierarchical, or causal).  
     – `importance` — one sentence (≤ 25 words) in **your own words** stating *why* the concept matters academically or professionally.  

7. **Generate assessments** for every key concept:  
   • Write one *recall* question (flashcard-style) whose answer is the definition.  
   • Write one *application* question whose answer requires using or recognising the concept in context.  
   • Provide a **difficulty tag**: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` (Bloom levels: remember/understand = easy, apply/analyse = medium, evaluate/create = hard).  

8. **Create summaries**:  
   • For each main topic, craft a micro-summary (≤ 40 words) that stitches its concepts together.  
   • Compose a *global overview* (≤ 120 words) that frames how all topics relate.  

9. **Validate** every field: fill with a value or the exact phrase "Not specified". Never invent factual content; only summarise or paraphrase what is present except where the step explicitly calls for your own wording (importance sentences & questions).  

**Output** a single well-formed JSON object in the *exact* schema below — no commentary, blank lines, or extra keys.
